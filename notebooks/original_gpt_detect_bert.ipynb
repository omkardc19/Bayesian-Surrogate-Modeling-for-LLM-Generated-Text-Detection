Why I think we should remove the Electoral College is when voter selects the president they want they are really just picking for a electors who elects the president for them. Also this makes a single rep from Wyoming of 500,00 people has as much say as 55 reps for California who represents 35 million people. The last reason behind this is also being unfair to voters, the winner take all system where in the state the winner of the votes gets them all. So in effect a candidate would spend no time in that per say a swing state. which the may have a chance of winning.\\n\\nWhen you vote for the president you really are not voting for him, you're voting for a electors who really elect the president. Also the question is brought up, who picks the electorss? This also depends on the state could be the state party's central committee or the presidential candidate's people do. Also another question is what controls the electors from electing the wrong candidate, nothing.\\n\\nAlso why does a single reps in Wyoming with 500,00 people have as much say as 55 reps in California with 35 million people? That is just unfair to the voters, how could that in anyway represent what the majority of the people want. The other way the electorsal collage is unfair is the winner take all system I mentioned earlier with majority votes in a state is the state vote, such as if 46 percent of people in a state voted one candidate and 54 for the other insted of just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is also not a democratic system of voting because the people are really not deciding, and when it is said you are allowing each party to pick a trusted slate of nominees it is not true because the state's central committee not the presidential candidate's reps who are the people really needed to vote for such. In 2000 Gore had more popular votes than bush but less electorsal votes, though rare to happen this the president who runs the country for four years at a time so that one rare moment could mean the future of the U.S.A. Also a president does not need to be transregional, they only need to appeal to swing states and not ruin relations with their states.\\n\\nSo that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electorss not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states. I hope this passage convinces you that the Electoral College should be removed in place of a better system that is not out dated.\",\n          \"Do you ever wonder how it would be if we lived in a car free environment where cars where limited. There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our environment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.\\n\\nPeople with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservative type of transportation, its nonsensical to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necessary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.\\n\\nThink of our environment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our environment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the environment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our environment and our health as people as well.\\n\\nCars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our environment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.\\n\\nCars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your environment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our environment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.\",\n          \"  The Path to Sustainable Urban Development  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
